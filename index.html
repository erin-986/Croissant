    <p>
      The first step of manufacturing croissants is the "predough" formation. To
      prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are
      mixed together in a single step. Typically, croissant predough is mixed in
      a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other pastries. The
      ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19°C, to best hydrate the
      ingredients. In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients,
      pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as
      soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough
      development in the next step.
